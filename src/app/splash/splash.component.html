    You have the opportunity to play five hands, one card at a time. Click on the “Add Card” button for the hand that you
    want to add the card to. The basic rules of cribbage apply:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      You get two points for each pair. If you have three of the same card, you then get six (three separate pairs for
      two
      points each). Four of the same give you 12.
    </li>
    <li>
      You get one point for each card in a run (four, five, six) is three points. Eight, nine, 10, or J is four points.
      One through five yields five points.
    </li>
    <li>
      You get two points for each combination of 15 (one of the many things that makes cribbage different!).
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have a Jack of the same suit as the “turn card” (the card showing after all the hands are full), you get
      a point. If the “turn card” itself is a Jack, then you get two points.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Each hand will be scored as it grows.
    When all hands are complete, then the total is calculated.
